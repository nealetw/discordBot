# discordBot

A bot that does a bunch of random things. Created from scratch by Tim Neale.
You can use the bot for your own server if you'd like, just message me about it and it'll be perfectly fine.

I'll link to where I got my libraries eventually, but just look them up by name and it shouldn't be too hard.


***Things it can do***
*Play music from Youtube links*
*Roll dice (Multiple at a time)*
*Spam random crap that I think is funny to wherever you want*
